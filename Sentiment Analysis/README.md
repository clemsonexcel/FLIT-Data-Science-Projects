# Sentiment Analysis for Product Review

## Introdution

In this project, we dive into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by conducting sentiment analysis on product reviews from an e-commerce platform. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves evaluating and categorizing opinions expressed in text data to determine the sentiment of the writer towards a subject or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The aim is to classify the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral, which can provide valuable insights for businesses regarding customer satisfaction and product improvements.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Analyze and classify the sentiment of product reviews.
- Enhance our understanding of text analysis and machine learning techniques for sentiment classification.
- Build a predictive model that can accurately determine the sentiment expressed in a review.

## Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes Python and several of its libraries, including:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- SpaCy: For advanced natural language processing.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the project workflow.
- GitHub: For version control and sharing our project.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset for this project consists of product reviews collected from an e-commerce platform. Each entry includes the text of the review and a star rating, ranging from 1 to 5, which reflects the customer's satisfaction with the product. Our analysis will focus on processing and classifying these reviews to gauge sentiment.
